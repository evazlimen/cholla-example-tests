# 3D Sod Shock Test (High resolution version)
This is a higher resolution version of the sod shock test, with a grid of 256x256x256.
Illustrates the ability of a code to resolve shocks and contact discontinuities over a narrow region. The test consists of two constant states (on left pressure and density are equal to 1; on right they are equal to 0.1) separated by a discontinuity at 0.5. Gamma is set to 1.4. This test is performed with the default hydro build (`cholla/builds/make.type.hydro`).

Upon completion, you should obtain two output files. The initial and final densities (in code units) of a slice along the y-midplane is shown below. Examples of how to plot projections and slices can be found in `cholla/python_scripts/Projection_Slice_Tutorial.ipynb`.  
<img src="./images/sod256_density_xz.png" alt="Two 2D histograms side by side, showing density of cells in the z direction vs cells in x direction. The leftmost is the initial density plot with a constant density of 1 throughout all 256 y cells between x-cells 0 through 128 and a constant density of 0.1 between x cells 128 through 256. The rightmost plot is the final density plot at t = 0.20 with a nonconstant density in x and constant density in z. A density of 1 transitions abruptly to a density 0.8 around x = 70 cells, then gradually lessens to 0.6 around x = 125 cells. An abrupt change occurs at x = 170 cells to a density of 0.3 and the final abrupt transition is at x = 225 cells to a density of 0.2" width="1200" />  
We see a smoother density gradient within the rarefaction wave due to the higher resolution.
A skewer in x along and y and z midplanes yields the traditional 1-dimension solution:  
<img src="./images/sod256_density_x.png" alt="On top are two scatter plots side by side of density vs cells in the x direction. The leftmost is the initial density plot with a density of 1 between x-cells 0 through 128 and a density of 0.1 between x cells 128 through 256. The rightmost plot is the final density plot at t = 0.20. A density of 1 transitions abruptly to a density 0.8 around x = 70 cells, then gradually lessens to 0.6 around x = 125 cells. An abrupt change occurs at x = 170 cells to a density of 0.3 and the final abrupt transition is at x = 225 cells to a density of 0.2. Below is two scatter plots side by side of pressure vs cells in the x direction. The leftmost plot is the initial pressure function of 1 from cells 0 to 128 and 0.1 from cells 128 to 256. The rightmost plot is the final pressure function, which is at 1 from 0 to 80 cells where is gradually decreases to 0.3 around x=125 cells. It is constant here until around x = 225 cells where it discontinuously jumps to a 0.2." width="1200" />  
We can see a rarefaction wave on the left side, followed first by a contact discontinuity and then a shock. Transitions between shocks are resolved more narrowly.
