# 1D Sound Wave
This test initializes a compression/rarefaction wave across the grid. The setup consists of an initial density and pressure of 1.0 and 0.6, respectively. A sound wave is initialized as a sinusoidal wave with amplitude 1e-4 and wavelength of 1.0. Gamma is set to 1.666666666666667. This test was performed with the hydro build (`cholla/builds/make.type.hydro`). Full initial conditions can be found in `cholla/src/grid/initial_conditions.cpp`under `Sound_Wave()`.

Upon completion, you should obtain five output files. By changing the outstep to 0.005, we can obtain the evolution of the pressure and density (here at 4 fps).  Examples of how to extract and plot data can be found in `cholla/python_scripts/plot_sod.ipynb`.

We see alternating regions of rarefaction and compression moving rightwards.
